# 📊 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analytics case study focused on understanding customer shopping behavior using transactional data. The objective is to transform raw customer data into actionable business insights through data cleaning, analysis, database querying, and interactive visualization.

The project simulates a real-world analytics workflow, starting from raw CSV data to a final Power BI dashboard that supports data-driven decision-making.


🎯 Objectives
	•	Analyze customer purchasing patterns and behavior
	•	Identify revenue trends and high-value customer segments
	•	Compare subscriber vs non-subscriber performance
	•	Understand the impact of discounts and shipping methods
	•	Build an interactive dashboard for business stakeholders


🗂 Dataset Description
	•	Total Records: ~3,900 customer transactions
	•	Data Type: Structured transactional data
	•	Key Attributes:
	•	Customer demographics (age, gender)
	•	Purchase amount
	•	Product category
	•	Subscription status
	•	Discount usage
	•	Shipping type
	•	Payment method
	•	Purchase frequency


🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
	•	Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning & preprocessing
	•	SQL – Data querying and analysis
	•	PostgreSQL – Database storage and management
	•	Power BI – Interactive dashboards & data visualization
	•	Jupyter Notebook – Exploratory data analysis


🔄 Project Workflow
	1.	Data Ingestion
	•	Loaded raw CSV data using Python (Pandas)
	•	Performed initial inspection and validation
	2.	Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
	•	Handled missing and inconsistent values
	•	Standardized categorical variables
	•	Created derived features for analysis
	3.	Database Integration
	•	Stored cleaned data in PostgreSQL
	•	Performed analytical queries using SQL
	4.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Analyzed customer demographics
	•	Studied purchase behavior and spending patterns
	•	Evaluated subscription and discount impact
	5.	Data Visualization
	•	Built an interactive Power BI dashboard
	•	Designed visuals for business interpretation
	•	Focused on clarity and storytelling


📈 Key Insights
	•	Male customers contribute a higher share of total revenue
	•	Only a small percentage of customers are subscribers, indicating strong growth potential
	•	Customers using express shipping tend to spend slightly more per transaction
	•	Discount users include several high-value customers, making them ideal for loyalty programs
	•	Certain product categories consistently drive higher revenue


📊 Dashboard Features
	•	Revenue breakdown by gender and age group
	•	Subscriber vs non-subscriber comparison
	•	Product category performance
	•	Discount and shipping analysis
	•	Interactive filters for deeper exploration
